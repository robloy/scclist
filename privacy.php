<h2>Privacy Policy ...</h2>

    <blockquote><blockquote>
            <p>
                <?php print(_SITENAME); ?> has established this privacy policy to explain to you how your
                information is protected, collected and used, which may be updated by

                significant changes to this privacy policy by posting notice on the
                <?php print(_SITENAME); ?> site.
            <p><h4>1. Protecting your privacy</h4>
            <ul>

                <li>We don't send you unsolicited communications for marketing purposes.
                <li>We offer <a href=/about/anonymize>
                        email anonymization & relay</a>, to reduce 3rd party
                    harvesting & spam.
                <li>Account information is password-protected. Keep your password safe.
                <li>Forums use basic webserver authentication. Close your browser to log out.
                <li><?php print(_SITENAME); ?> does not knowingly collect any information from persons under
                    the age of 13.  If <?php print(_SITENAME); ?> learns that a posting is by a person under the
                    age of 13, <?php print(_SITENAME); ?> will remove that post.
                <li><?php print(_SITENAME); ?>, or people who post on <?php print(_SITENAME); ?>, may provide links to third
                    party websites, which may have different privacy practices.  We are not
                    responsible for, nor have any control over, the privacy policies of those
                    third party websites, and encourage all users to read the privacy policies
                    of each and every website visited.
            </ul>

                    diagnose problems with our server, to administer the <?php print(_SITENAME); ?> site, and to
                    otherwise provide our service to you.
            </ul>
            <h4>3. Data we store</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>All classified and forum postings are stored in our database, even after
                    "deletion," and may be archived elsewhere.
                <li>Our web logs and other records are stored indefinitely.

            <h4>5. Circumstances in which <?php print(_SITENAME); ?> may release information</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><?php print(_SITENAME); ?> may disclose information about its users if required to do so
                    by law or in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably

                <li><?php print(_SITENAME); ?> may also disclose information about its users to law
                    enforcement officers or others, in the good faith belief that such
